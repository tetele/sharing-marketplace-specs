# Sharing Marketplace specifications

This document defines functional and technical specifications of the Sharing Marketplace project.

## Context

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are trying to put together a platform dedicated to putting together people or institutions who need goods or services with people or institutions who can provide goods and services. Moreover, if some of these transactions require investment that is unavailable from the requesters, the platform is also targeted at investors (again, people or institutions) who choose to fund the fulfillment of these transactions.
